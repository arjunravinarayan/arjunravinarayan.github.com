Todo list for things that are broken on the blog.

** Make the left hand headers text based.
   
** Limit the text width on posts

** Quoted font is different, and bigger that normal text. WTF?

** Pic too big, and the circle is too small.

** On Mobile version, the "categories" and "tags" still show up.
