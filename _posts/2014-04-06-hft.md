Much has been said on the tubes about High Frequency Trading, now that
Michael Lewis' new book [Flash
Boys](http://books.google.com/books?id=UcIkAwAAQBAJ) is out. Michael
Lewis' book is anti-HFT (I have not yet read it, although I much
enjoyed Liar's Poker and The Big Short), arguing that it serves no
useful societal function but merely transfers money from "the little
guys" to the HFT hedge
funds. [Here](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/flash-boys-michael-lewis.html?_r=0)
is an excerpt in last week's New York Times.

Here is a collection of interesting commentary that I have found so
far on the topic. Note that there is a bottomless pit of cheap talk on
this subject, and everybody has an opinion. I've tried to restrict
these to a set of good basis vectors that cover the entire vectorspace
of the debate.

* [Rajiv
Sethi](http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2014/04/superfluous-financial-intermediation.html)
gives a couple instances that clearly show that *some* HFT adds
nothing to the market, but merely extract some surplus that would
otherwise have accrued to the other traders.

* [Felix
  Salmon](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/03/31/michael-lewiss-flawed-new-book/)
  criticizes the book, arguing that in fact HFT *helps* the little guy
  with the ETrade account at the expense of the big institutional
  funds, which is the reverse of what Michael Lewis says it does.

* [James Kwak](http://baselinescenario.com/2014/04/04/incidence/)
  argues that Felix Salmon is wrong, because "big institutional funds"
  really means 401ks, IRAs, i.e. grandma's retirement money, so it's
  still siphoning off "the little guy's" money for no net societal
  gain.

* The founder of Vanguard (the company that has done the most to help
  small investors get the most return at the cheapest fees), John
  Bogle, [argues that HFT helps the little
  guys](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jack-bogle-michael-lewis-is-wrong-about-rigged-markets/)
  because the lowered bid-ask spreads benefit the large funds, which are in turn owned by the little guys.

* [Tyler
  Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/04/flash-boys-the-new-michael-lewis-book.html)
  adds his predictably contrarian view that the book offers a "fun"
  narrative, and that it clearly wasn't intended to be a fair and
  balanced book and that somehow excuses it from any criticism. I'm
  not quite sure why I'm even including this here, but perhaps there's
  a Straussian angle that my subconscious needs to get out... (Aside:
  why isn't there a good Tyler Cowen blog post generator? Must I do
  everything myself?)

* [Noah
  Smith](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/no-one-really-knows-if-hft-is-good-or.html)
  offers an agnostic viewpoint that we don't really know if HFT is
  good or bad, so we should have many exchanges with different rules
  for and against HFT, to let the market decide. He offers an
  important addendum that the term "HFT" is nebulous and includes many
  diverse traders with diverse strategies, and thus is greatly
  confusing the debate.

* *UPDATE*: [Chris
   Stucchio](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/fervent_defense_of_frontrunning_hfts.html)
   has a great defense of high frequency trading, as an improvement to
   pit trading. It's a fun read, although it does not address the
   fundamental mechanism design question later on.

Of the above posts, I found Rajiv Sethi's and Noah Smith's
contributions most useful. I like Rajiv Sethi's post because it offers
a couple clear scenarios where HFTs extract rents without offering any
clear value to society at all. Rajiv Sethi calls this "superfluous
financial intermediation", or when the HFT inserts herself between two
traders who would have traded anyway, and arbitrages herself a slice
of the surplus from the trade. She does not make the trade happen
(i.e. this is not "[market
making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker)"), and she does
not provide liquidity to the market. If these trades were made
illegal, nothing of value would be lost.

I like Noah Smith's post because because it is level-headed and clear,
explaining that "HFT" as a term covers a large, nebulous set of
strategies. He doesn't get muddled up in value judgements about
whether little guys are hurt, etc. It makes the important point that
economic theorists are not settled on whether "[noise
traders](http://www.stanford.edu/~milgrom/publishedarticles/Information%20Trade%20and%20Common%20Knowledge.pdf)"
might actually be necessary to oil the wheels of the market. In
essence, we know very little about the stock market in general, and a
lot of the critiques are just talking past each other. So principled
experimentation would be the wisest course of action. This would also
give people the option to trade in markets without HFT action, and
with HFT action, so people would have to put their money where their
mouth is.
