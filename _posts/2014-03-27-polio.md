A couple months ago I [posted an
argument](http://www.arjunnarayan.com/2014/01/20/polio/) for why polio
eradication makes sense despite the high per-unit cost. Well, you
don't have to do with my shoddy arguments now because [this
article](http://qz.com/191860/why-its-worth-it-to-eradicate-polio/#b03g27t20w14)
makes the point with actual data.
