*If your theory is that John Paulson is an idiot, maybe you're the idiot.*

## John Paulson ## 

John Paulson [donated $400 million to
Harvard](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/education/john-paulson-gives-400-million-to-harvard-for-engineering-school.html). [Predictably](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8723189/john-paulson-harvard-donation),

[lot of people
upset](http://qz.com/418905/john-paulsons-400-million-gift-to-harvard-shows-exactly-whats-wrong-with-big-university-endowments/). And
not unjustifiably, so: Harvard is the richest university, it
can't possibly need more money. That said, I'm seeing a lot of
idiocy making the rounds. Sure, the peanut gallery writes good
one liners that excel on twitter, and given that [even Malcolm
Gladwell](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8725331/malcolm-gladwell-harvard)
joined the fray, it's been an entertaining Wednesday. But I
haven't seen a single coherent argument that even plausibly
explains John Paulson's underlying reasoning and why it's wrong.

Let me explain: whatever the true underlying state of the world
is, it has to both explain why John Paulson thinks donating large
sums of money to Harvard is a good idea, and why that idea is
wrong. It can't be a simplistic pastiche that paints him as a
cartoon villain. It has to *coherently explain* his underlying
investment thesis, accounting for the fact that John Paulson has
made many nuanced, well reasoned, successful investment theses in
the past, as well as why said thesis is wrong (or maybe it isn't
wrong! Maybe John Paulson is right after all!)


## An Internet of Straw Men ##

Unfortunately, the blagosphere excels at this kind of cartoon
fight. While these simplistic opinions (Vox and Slate, for
example, excel at this genre of outrage manufacturing) are a step
forward from the total cop-out of Cable News (CNN: We have no
opinion!  Here are two arbitrary sides of an important debate!
Who's correct? You decide!), they are still pretty simplistic and
off-track.

One other similar media-manufactured outrage event that got my
goat enough to actually blog about it was [the Herbalife
short]({% post_url 2014-03-24-herbalife %}).  Every idiot had an
opinion, and they generally fell into two camps: the "Bill Ackman
is an idiot" camp, and the "Carl Icahn is an idiot camp". But if
your mental model of two billionaires who run successful hedge
funds is that one of them is an idiot, I posit that your model
does not explain the data. Yes, there is an idiot. It's the one
creating the model.

It's not often that smart, successful people are cartoon
idiots. Sure, they might be *wrong*, but it's probably something
*subtle*. You know, the kind of thing that someone with billions
of dollars, large offices full of bright analysts from the best
universities, and with lots of domain expertise get wrong. If
your thesis is that humans are stupid and make mistakes, I expect
at least three citations to [Daniel
Kahneman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)
as to why this is a real, verified blind spot that smart people
regularly fail to see. If your thesis is that their decisions are
made and vetted by sclerotic institutions that are hamstrung by
incentive incompatibilities, resulting in a morass of bad
decisions, I expect empirical evidence, and historical traces
that explain how those institutions came to be. You can't just
wave your hands and say ["Elan
vital"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital). That's not
an explanation. That's just naming the phenomenon, except we're
all stupider for reading it, because we walk away with a smug
satisfaction that we now understand the world, and it's
populated by idiots (except us!).


## A Hierarchy of John Paulson Models ##


Instead, how about a little humility? Let's assume that John
Paulson is not an idiot (Why, how charitable of us!). I'm going to
be so bold as to posit the ridiculous notion that, perhaps, John
Paulson, with his successful track record in mergers and
acquisitions, deciphering complex derivatives, and making big
macroeconomic bets that paid off, is smarter than me. I'm further
going to assume that John Paulson is smarter than anybody bored
enough to read my blog.

Perhaps there is some underlying truth to the matter that we
don't see... Let's try and construct successively more charitable
models of John Paulson and see where this takes us:


### Level Zero ###

*Example*: John Paulson is evil. First, he's a capitalist. Worse,
he's a successful capitalist. He made lots of money by betting
that people would be unable to pay their mortgages. People unable
to pay their mortgages is bad. QED, John Paulson is
bad. Something, something, Shylock, vague anti-semitic
references.

*Culprits*: Mercifully, no mainstream news organization is bad enough to make
this argument. But some do conveniently bring up the large CDO
shorts that John Paulson made money off of, and [waggle their
eyebrows suggestively](http://m.xkcd.com/552/). But, hey, its
charity day today. Let's assume that they were just giving
readers some helpful context, with no bad intentions, and move
on.

*Scorecard*: While I wish we lived in a world where it didn't need to be
explicitly stated, It bears repeating that if anyone actually
makes this argument (tip: don't search "John Paulson" on Twitter
for a few days) I award them no points, and may God have mercy on
their soul.

### Level One ###

*Example*: John Paulson is an idiot. He's surrounded by cronies
in an epistemic bubble. He has no idea what real suffering is. He
gives money to Harvard because he's completely lost touch with
reality.

*Culprits*: Vox. No, really,
[Vox](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8723189/john-paulson-harvard-donation)! (
[We're not mad, your mother and I are just
disappointed](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou). We
expected so much of you, Ezra...)

*Scorecard*:  Zero points. Unfollowed on twitter. Unsubscribed from RSS.

### Level Two ###

*Example*: John Paulson is
[SIGNALING](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-27/economists-need-to-give-up-on-overused-signaling-fad)!
Also, I am signaling how smart I am by the fact I describe every
action as signaling, but never mind that. Back to John Paulson's
signaling. He's signaling that he has money to throw away. But
he's giving it away at lowest cost: he gets a tax break, but it's
going to sit in a university endowment, which is managed (after a
few layers of indirection) by people like John Paulson. So
really, he's not giving it away at all.

*Culprits*:
[Quartz](http://qz.com/418905/john-paulsons-400-million-gift-to-harvard-shows-exactly-whats-wrong-with-big-university-endowments/).

*Scorecard*: Zero points. Take a class on game theory.

### Level Two point Five ###

*Example*: John Paulson is *raising his status* by affiliating
with Harvard. His rival, Steve Schwarzman, [recently gave $150
million to
Yale](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/05/12/stephen_schwarzman_yale_gift_so_many_better_uses_for_that_money.html). And
John Paulson just couldn't have that. Everyone needs to know that
he has [the biggest, swingiest dick in the
	    business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker#Catch_phrases).

*Culprits*: [Malcolm
 Gladwell](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8725331/malcolm-gladwell-harvard),
 and if you wanted to be generous, you could upgrade the above
 Quartz article one level into this category.

*Scorecard*: One point. This is at least a credible theory. We have
 prior empirical evidence that financiers do stupid alpha-male
 things. But, somehow, it's lacking... Really, that's all you have to
 say? Why say it at all? In other news, water still wet, Pope Francis
 still shitting in the woods. Besides it's not very convincing. John
 Paulson doesn't say many things to the media. He doesn't seem to be
 the type.

### Level Three ###

*Example*: I don't understand John Paulson's actions. I notice that I am
confused. I'm confused because I'm an effective altruist. I believe
money should be given to the maximally efficient charity. Harvard, on
the other hand, [is not capital
constrained](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University#Endowment)
in any meaningful way. $400 million is a lot of opportunity cost. This
doesn't make sense.

*Features*: Nobody, really, in this case. But one other situation
 where I saw this happen was when Facebook bought WhatsApp, and the
 media immediately started on the predictable "Mark Zuckerberg is an
 idiot" routine. One notable standout was Paul Graham (I can't find
 the link right now, but it's some interview of Paul around this
 time), where he said "My response was 'Wow! I didn't realize WhatsApp
 was worth 19 billion!'". That's exactly the attitude required to
 begin to seriously model the world.

*Scorecard*: Hundred points for acknowledging that you don't
 understand what's going on, and that it's befuddling. Seriously, this
 happens so rarely on the internet, there should be awards for this.

### Level Five ###

*Example*: John Paulson has a coherent thesis for why donating to
Harvard is maximally efficient charity. I know this because John
Paulson is a shrewd investor who has coherent theses for everything he
does. Even Peter Thiel (who is smart) saw the housing crash coming and
*lost money* trying to execute a bet on that thesis. John Paulson not
only saw it, he successfully executed a series of trades that made him
billions off the event.

John Paulson *is an allocator of capital*. That is what he does. He is
unlikely to suddenly change his frame and donate large sums of
*capital* without thinking it through his framework of allocating
capital. Perhaps John Paulson thinks that the social returns to
investment follow some sort of power law, and thus, doubling down on
the world's foremost institution at generating knowledge that betters
humanity is the right way to go about maximizing returns. (How would
you test such a hypothesis?).

*Features*: Sadly, nobody.
