Turns out [Chapter 22 of the Feynman
Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_22.html) is a fun
and accessible introduction to abstract algebra. This being my
favorite undergraduate math class, I had to take a look. It's a must
read for anyone who ever uses math for anything.

The chapter explains a lot of _why_ algebra seems so tedious in middle
school. Your suspicions were right: It is just definitions and
definitions upon definitions. But they are constructed that way for a
reason - and this is the best essay that walks us through the
historical process.

Someday (file this one under "projects for retirement") I'd like to
push through all of elementary abstract algebra through a proof
assistant like [Coq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq). I'm now in the
camp that doesn't trust paper proofs by humans. *Real* proofs are
computer checked, with a minimal carefully scrutinized trusted base. I
spent this past summer pushing through some proofs about fixed-point
and rational arithmetic in
[Dafny](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dafny/), which
turned out be far slower and far more interesting than I thought it
could possibly be.

Returning to the Feynman Lectures, I particularly like section 22-4,
which ends with "This is how logarithms were originally computed by
Mr. Briggs of Halifax, in 1620.  \[...\] He made tables of logarithms
to fourteen decimal places by this method, which is quite tedious. But
all logarithm tables for three hundred years were borrowed from
Mr. Briggs' tables. \[...\] Only in modern times, with the WPA and
computing machines, have new tables been independently computed." I
had never heard of [Henry
Briggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Briggs_%28mathematician%29)
before, but it turns out he published the original log tables.

Thanks Mr. Briggs!
